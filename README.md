## Greetings
My name is Spencer Gannon and I am a B.S. Computer Science major with a complementary Mathematics major.

## Cool Projects I've Done 
- **Quantum Dot Cellular Automata Simulator** - Currently this is private, but working with a physics major and the Dean of Engineering we created a quantum dot cellular automata simulator that allows us to simulate sizeable quantum circuits. It currently runs in polynomial time complexity which is better than the current industry solution that runs in exponential time complexity.
- **Old Home Server** - This can't be found on my GitHub, but I turned a 2012 Apple Mac Pro 5.1 (see below) into a home server. It ran Proxmox VE which itself ran 3 virtual machines, one running TrueNAS Scale and two running Arch Linux. The two Arch instances ran Jellyfin and the other ran Docker containers, one of which ran Cloudflare and tunneled Jellyfin and other services out of my local network to the internet. The only downside was that the machine had to be connected via WiFi due to space constraints.
- **New Home Server** - My current home server runs off of an HP ProDesk 400 G4 small form factor machine. It has an Intel i5-7600 (4 cores, 4 threads) at a clock speed of 4.100GHz. It has a 1 TB internal SSD and runs all of the same services that the Mac did, but this time the small form factor allowed me to connect it to and house it under the router.
