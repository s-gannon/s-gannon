## Greetings
My name is Spencer Gannon and I am a Bachelor of Science Computer Science and Complementary Mathematics major.

## Cool Projects I've Done 
- **Quantum Dot Cellular Automata Simulator** - Currently this is private, but working with a physics major and the Dean of Engineering we created a quantum dot cellular automata simulator that allows us to simulate sizeable quantum circuits. It currently runs in polynomial time complexity which is better than the current industry solution that runs in exponential time complexity.
- **Old Home Server** - This can't be found on my GitHub, but I turned a 2012 Apple Mac Pro 5.1 (see below) into a home server. It ran Proxmox VE which itself ran 3 virtual machines, one running TrueNAS Scale and two running Arch Linux. The two Arch instances ran Jellyfin and the other ran Docker containers, one of which ran Cloudflare and tunneled Jellyfin and other services out of my local network to the internet. The only downside was that the machine had to be connected via WiFi due to space constraints.
- **New Home Server** - My current home server runs off of an HP ProDesk 400 G4 small form factor machine. It has an Intel i5-7600 (4 cores, 4 threads) at a clock speed of 4.100GHz. It has a 1 TB internal SSD and runs all of the same services that the Mac did, but this time the small form factor allowed me to connect it to and house it under the router.
- **The Loki Project** - My freshman year of college, 2020, I worked on scripts as well as created some videos to enable myself to create "duplicates" of myself in the background of my Zoom calls for class as well as "body doubles" that would fill in for me during the occasional 7:30 AM Calculus II (sorry Professor Drube). A Python script was originally created to keep me on-time for my Zoom classes by logging me in and out of class provided the link and the time start and end stored in a text file. Zoom was automated using computer vision and the pyautogui library. There was work being done to automate OBS to automatically record said Calculus II classes, but at the time the recording was done manually. Work can be found [in my repositories](https://github.com/s-gannon/meetingbot).
